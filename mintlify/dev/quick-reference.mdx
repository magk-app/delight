# Developer Quick Reference Card

**Print this or keep it open while coding!**

---

## The 6-Stage Story Workflow

```
SELECT → PREPARE → DEVELOP → TEST → REVIEW → COMPLETE
```

---

## Stage Checklist

### 1. SELECT

- [ ] Check `docs/sprint-status.yaml` for next backlog story
- [ ] Read story in `docs/epics.md`
- [ ] Verify prerequisites are "done"

### 2. PREPARE

- [ ] Optional: Run `@bmad/bmm/workflows/story-context`
- [ ] Update `sprint-status.yaml` to "in-progress"
- [ ] Verify Supabase connection (DATABASE_URL in .env)
- [ ] Create branch: `git checkout -b story/X-Y-short-name`

### 3. DEVELOP

- [ ] Create implementation checklist
- [ ] Start backend & frontend servers
- [ ] Implement features
- [ ] Test manually as you go
- [ ] Run linters before testing

### 4. TEST

- [ ] Manual test ALL acceptance criteria
- [ ] Write unit tests (backend + frontend)
- [ ] Write integration tests (if needed)
- [ ] All tests passing

### 5. REVIEW

- [ ] Complete self-review checklist
- [ ] Optional: Run `@bmad/bmm/workflows/code-review`
- [ ] Update `sprint-status.yaml` to "review" or "done"

### 6. COMPLETE

- [ ] Create story summary
- [ ] Update `.cursor-changes`
- [ ] Commit with detailed message
- [ ] Merge to main
- [ ] Clean up branch
- [ ] Celebrate!

## Common Commands

### Start Development

<CodeGroup>

```bash Backend
cd packages/backend
poetry run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

```bash Frontend
cd packages/frontend
npm run dev
```

```bash Optional: Redis
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:7
# OR use Upstash (serverless, free tier)
```

</CodeGroup>

<Note>
No Docker required for database! Supabase provides managed PostgreSQL. Only use Docker for local Redis if not using Upstash.
</Note>

### Testing

```bash
# Backend tests
cd packages/backend
poetry run pytest -v --cov=app

# Frontend tests
cd packages/frontend
npm test -- --coverage --watchAll=false

# E2E tests
cd packages/frontend
npm run test:e2e
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Backend
cd packages/backend
poetry run black .
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run mypy app

# Frontend
cd packages/frontend
npm run lint
npm run type-check
```

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Create branch
git checkout -b story/1-3-short-name

# Commit
git add .
git commit -m "Story X.Y: Title

Details here"

# Merge
git checkout main
git merge story/1-3-short-name
git push origin main
```

---

## Files to Update

### During Development

- Code files (obviously!)
- Tests (`tests/` or `__tests__/`)

### Before Commit

- `docs/sprint-status.yaml` → Update status
- `docs/stories/story-X.Y-summary.md` → Create summary
- `.cursor-changes` → Log changes
- `README.md` → If new setup/env vars

---

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing

```bash
poetry install && npm install
docker-compose restart
rm -rf .next __pycache__
```

### Port Already in Use

```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :8000

# Mac/Linux
lsof -i :8000
```

### Database Issues

```bash
# Supabase: Check connection
echo $DATABASE_URL

# Re-run migrations
cd packages/backend
poetry run alembic upgrade head

# If using local Redis:
docker restart redis
```

### Git Conflicts

```bash
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout your-branch
git rebase main
# Fix conflicts, then:
git add .
git rebase --continue
```

---

## BMAD Workflows

```bash
# Before coding
@bmad/bmm/workflows/story-context

# During coding
@bmad/bmm/agents/dev

# Before commit
@bmad/bmm/workflows/code-review

# After testing
@bmad/bmm/workflows/story-done
```

---

## Story Status Values

- `backlog` → Not started yet
- `in-progress` → Currently working on it
- `review` → Ready for team review
- `done` → Completed and merged
- `deferred` → Postponed to later

---

## Testing Pyramid

```
    E2E (Few)
   Integration (Some)
  Unit (Many)
```

**Test every acceptance criterion at minimum!**

---

## Pro Tips

1. **Read the story twice** before coding
2. **Test as you build**, don't wait
3. **Commit frequently** (small commits)
4. **Write tests first** (TDD when possible)
5. **Take breaks** during self-review
6. **Ask questions** early and often
7. **Celebrate wins** (even small ones!)
