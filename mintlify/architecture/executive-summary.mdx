# Executive Summary

Delight is a self-improvement companion platform that blends emotionally-aware AI coaching with narrative world-building. The architecture is designed to support a **living narrative engine** where real-world goal achievement drives personalized story progression, multi-character AI interactions, and adaptive quest systems.

## Cost Model

The system prioritizes **premium AI experience** with a target operational cost of **\$0.50/user/day**

**Pricing Strategy:**
- \$1/day base subscription
- Pay-as-you-go for premium features
- Free tier for basic features

<Info>
**Actual Cost:** ~\$0.03/user/day using GPT-4o-mini for standard operations
</Info>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Real-Time Communication

### Hybrid Approach

**Server-Sent Events (SSE) + HTTP:**
- AI streaming responses
- User actions and CRUD operations
- Optimistic UI updates

**WebSocket (Future):**
- World state updates
- Character-initiated interactions
- Real-time notifications

## Novel Patterns

The Delight architecture introduces several innovative patterns:

### 1. Living Narrative Engine

Real-world goal achievement directly influences the story world:
- Completed missions unlock narrative events
- Progress changes world state
- Character relationships evolve with user actions

### 2. Character-Initiated Interactions

AI companions proactively reach out:
- Scheduled check-ins based on user patterns
- Contextual nudges when user is off-track
- Celebratory messages for achievements

### 3. Pre-Planned Hidden Quest System

Narrative arcs designed in advance:
- Quest chains unlock based on progress
- Hidden quests discovered through exploration
- Personalized story branches

## Technology Decisions

### Why Next.js 15?

- **Server Components** - Reduced JavaScript bundle
- **Streaming** - Progressive UI rendering
- **App Router** - Modern routing with layouts
- **React 19** - Latest hooks and features

### Why FastAPI?

- **Async-Native** - Perfect for AI orchestration
- **Type Safety** - Pydantic validation
- **Performance** - Comparable to Node.js
- **OpenAPI** - Automatic API documentation

### Why LangGraph?

- **Stateful Agents** - Maintain conversation context
- **Multi-Agent** - Character-based system
- **Observability** - Built-in debugging
- **Flexibility** - Customizable workflows

### Why PostgreSQL + pgvector?

- **Unified Storage** - Vectors + structured data
- **Production-Ready** - ACID guarantees
- **Cost-Effective** - No separate vector DB
- **LangChain Integration** - First-class support

## System Characteristics

### Performance Targets

  <Check>AI response time: <2s first token</Check>
  <Check>API latency: <100ms (p95)</Check>
  <Check>Page load: <1s (p95)</Check>
  <Check>Database queries: <50ms (p95)</Check>
</Checks>

### Scalability

**Current:**
- Single backend instance
- PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- Redis for job queuing

**Future (>10K users):**
- Horizontal backend scaling
- Read replicas for database
- CDN for static assets
- WebSocket service separation

### Reliability

**Targets:**
- 99.9% uptime (8.76 hours/year downtime)
- Zero data loss
- Graceful degradation

**Strategies:**
- Database backups (hourly via Supabase)
- Error tracking (Sentry)
- Health checks and monitoring
- Circuit breakers for external APIs
