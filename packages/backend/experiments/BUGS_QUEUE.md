# Bug 1: chat container when there are many messages, it shouldn't overflow beyond the background and create ugly white spaces

# Bug 2: I think there should be a better way to organize level 3 memories, this is the hierachy i believe:

level 1: is like major categories like personal, project, technical, social, professional, temporal, experiential, emotional, physical
level 2: is like subcategories or topics in that cateogires like resturants, artiifical intelligence, robotics, fear, or things like that
level 3: they are specific objects, and each object could have different types of attributes: like you could have Yoshinoya: and users favorite dish, etc things like that,
level 4: this is where the facts and stuff live, mostly relationship, and comparisons, and equality, things like that

# bug 3: there should be an optional way to link memories together through settings, and you can see what memories are linked, like for example if i say i love tokyo, perhpas that should link jack and tokyo, or even like i have a fear of talking to girls, then link fear: talking to girls, and girls: jack has a fear, just links like that so that distant things can be easily and quickly accessed

# bug 4:
