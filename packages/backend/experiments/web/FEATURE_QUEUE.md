# Phase 3

## Feature 1: Memory hireachy, like better organization of memories in general, and more complex objects.json, like jack attended university: [ucsb, mit, georgia tech], or yoshinoya { favorite dish: tonkatsu, price: $10, location: tokyo and america} like that

## Feature 2: Phase 3.2: Memory linking/graph relationships (so being able to tie different memories together to get the search to be even faster?)

# Phase 3.3: Enhanced fact extraction (detect entity-attribute-value triples)

# Phase 3.4: Memory deduplication and merging (somewhat worked on as well)
