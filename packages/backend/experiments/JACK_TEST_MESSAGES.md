# MESSAGE 1

Jack Luo is a highly driven founder and builder who spends most of his waking hours designing and shipping AI products like Delight, Efficore, Mira, Ophelus, and various experimental tools for productivity, memory, and relationship tracking, obsessing over details like monorepos, Next.js frontends, FastAPI backends, Postgres with pgvector, LangGraph based agents, and multi tier memory architectures that keep track of projects, tasks, and people; he is deeply fascinated by robotics, control, and futuristic tech such as humanoids and flying machines, and constantly thinks about how cities like New York, Boston, San Francisco, Tokyo, and Shanghai shape the kind of ambitious, high talent density environments he wants to live and work in; outside of pure tech, he actively pushes himself to meet more people through things like socials, dance events, and random “meet someone new” challenges while also wrestling with bouts of isolation and the difficulty of building a real support network from scratch; he goes to the gym consistently, tracks machines and weights in detail, and ties his physical training to larger goals like becoming a more reliable partner, teammate, and founder; he keeps a rich inner world through fiction projects such as Limbinal with characters like Fuka, experiments with music production and Japanese influenced aesthetics, analyzes his own dreams and motivations, and generally treats AI as a long term collaborator for code, writing, story worlds, logistics, and life planning, constantly evaluating what kind of work, people, and environments will let him have the largest possible impact over the next few decades.

# Message 2:

Jack Luo is a Chinese kid who grew up between Singapore and Shanghai, carries a mix of traditional Chinese values and Western habits, has somehow gone from hating natto to absolutely loving it, eats random things like plain sweet potatoes for dinner and still feels weirdly full, experiments with stuff like laksa broth and protein heavy meals while trying to lose weight and get lean, and prefers low trash, low dopamine food and media, which is why he refuses to touch TikTok even though he studies short video culture from the outside; he feels a deep emotional pull toward high talent, intense environments and spends a lot of time thinking about cities like Boston, New York, Tokyo and Shanghai as places where ambitious people cluster, all while dealing with long running feelings of isolation, a weak local support network, and the tension between craving deep, high quality relationships and being exhausted by maintaining too many shallow ones; culturally he is very into Japanese aesthetics, J pop, anime like cyberpunk adjacent stories, and likes weaving that into everything from the way he imagines future cities to the way he writes characters such as Fuka in his fiction, he uses the gym as a stabilizer for his mood and self respect, tracking his workouts and noticing that consistent training actually lifts his baseline happiness, and he spends a huge amount of time introspecting about his dreams, childhood, motivation issues, and the fear of wasting his potential, using AI both as a tool and as a kind of quiet companion while he tries to build a life that is technically impressive but also emotionally honest.

# Message 3:

Jack is the kind of person people assume is all sharp edges and ambition, but under the surface he is weirdly sentimental and haunted by very specific, almost cinematic memories, like a recurring dream where a mysterious girl gives him a car in exchange for something morally wrong, which he then overanalyzes as a metaphor for trading integrity for prestige in real life; he has quietly lied about small things like which dorm he lived in and how much time he really spent at certain institutions, not because he loves faking things, but because he is terrified that without those names people will not see his worth, and then spends hours feeling guilty and trying to untangle whether he is fundamentally dishonest or just scared. He can obsess over productivity systems and AI agents, then suddenly upload a whole different side of himself: someone who sits in silence eating sweet potatoes or natto, thinking about childhood, who enjoys old school Chinese ideas of discipline and duty and also wants the tranquility of art museums and elegant spaces. He has seriously considered going to therapy to unpack trauma, loneliness, and a strange fear of being truly known, yet he will casually joke about sleeping in conference rooms or grinding all night, because it feels safer to present as the funny, intense builder than the person who sometimes feels like an outsider everywhere. He loves Japanese culture and aesthetics, not just in a surface anime way, but in the idea of quiet perseverance and bittersweet endings, and that bleeds into his fiction, his imaginary cities, and even his music projects. He has a past with poker and a strong awareness of risk and expected value, yet emotionally he often behaves like someone who goes all in on people and places, then beats himself up when reality does not match the story in his head. Underneath the tech, projects, and public bravado, he spends an unusual amount of time worrying about whether he is a good friend, whether he has hurt people by omission or by performance, and whether he can somehow build a future that satisfies both the ambitious, status chasing kid and the quieter, more honest version of himself that still wants simple things like genuine friends, a decent relationship, and a life that feels internally coherent.
