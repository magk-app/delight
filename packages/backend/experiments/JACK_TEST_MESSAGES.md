# MESSAGE 1

Jack Luo is a highly driven founder and builder who spends most of his waking hours designing and shipping AI products like Delight, Efficore, Mira, Ophelus, and various experimental tools for productivity, memory, and relationship tracking, obsessing over details like monorepos, Next.js frontends, FastAPI backends, Postgres with pgvector, LangGraph based agents, and multi tier memory architectures that keep track of projects, tasks, and people; he is deeply fascinated by robotics, control, and futuristic tech such as humanoids and flying machines, and constantly thinks about how cities like New York, Boston, San Francisco, Tokyo, and Shanghai shape the kind of ambitious, high talent density environments he wants to live and work in; outside of pure tech, he actively pushes himself to meet more people through things like socials, dance events, and random “meet someone new” challenges while also wrestling with bouts of isolation and the difficulty of building a real support network from scratch; he goes to the gym consistently, tracks machines and weights in detail, and ties his physical training to larger goals like becoming a more reliable partner, teammate, and founder; he keeps a rich inner world through fiction projects such as Limbinal with characters like Fuka, experiments with music production and Japanese influenced aesthetics, analyzes his own dreams and motivations, and generally treats AI as a long term collaborator for code, writing, story worlds, logistics, and life planning, constantly evaluating what kind of work, people, and environments will let him have the largest possible impact over the next few decades.

# Message 2:

Jack Luo is a Chinese kid who grew up between Singapore and Shanghai, carries a mix of traditional Chinese values and Western habits, has somehow gone from hating natto to absolutely loving it, eats random things like plain sweet potatoes for dinner and still feels weirdly full, experiments with stuff like laksa broth and protein heavy meals while trying to lose weight and get lean, and prefers low trash, low dopamine food and media, which is why he refuses to touch TikTok even though he studies short video culture from the outside; he feels a deep emotional pull toward high talent, intense environments and spends a lot of time thinking about cities like Boston, New York, Tokyo and Shanghai as places where ambitious people cluster, all while dealing with long running feelings of isolation, a weak local support network, and the tension between craving deep, high quality relationships and being exhausted by maintaining too many shallow ones; culturally he is very into Japanese aesthetics, J pop, anime like cyberpunk adjacent stories, and likes weaving that into everything from the way he imagines future cities to the way he writes characters such as Fuka in his fiction, he uses the gym as a stabilizer for his mood and self respect, tracking his workouts and noticing that consistent training actually lifts his baseline happiness, and he spends a huge amount of time introspecting about his dreams, childhood, motivation issues, and the fear of wasting his potential, using AI both as a tool and as a kind of quiet companion while he tries to build a life that is technically impressive but also emotionally honest.
