# Clerk Authentication
# Get from https://dashboard.clerk.com → Your App → API Keys

# PUBLIC KEY - Safe to expose in browser (has NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...

# SECRET KEY - Used for SERVER-SIDE Next.js middleware (NO NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
# This is SAFE because Next.js keeps non-NEXT_PUBLIC_ variables server-side only
# The middleware runs on the server, so the secret never reaches the browser
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# API Configuration
# Point to your backend server
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Waitlist Form
# Google Forms URL for waitlist signup (optional - has fallback)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WAITLIST_FORM_URL=https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSek-5i4Kdd6iRTKEhTVD3pjI0AAtnZ9_cGajk6oFeEXlb998g/viewform

# SECURITY NOTE: 
# In Next.js with App Router, the "frontend" project contains both:
# - Client-side code (runs in browser) - can ONLY access NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables
# - Server-side code (middleware, server components) - can access all variables
# 
# CLERK_SECRET_KEY is used by server-side middleware and NEVER sent to the browser.
# This is different from traditional SPAs where everything runs client-side.
