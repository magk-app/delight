## 2025-11-09: Solutioning Gate Check - Implementation Decisions

### Summary

Completed comprehensive solutioning gate check and resolved 5 high/medium priority implementation issues based on user feedback. Project readiness improved from 79% to 81%.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Architecture Document Updates (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`)

**Added: Scenario Template Storage Strategy (lines 293-345)**

- PostgreSQL JSONB schema for narrative scenarios
- Template structure with examples (narrative_arc, character_prompts, hidden_quests)
- Supports dynamic scenario generation without code changes
- Scalable approach for adding new narrative themes

```sql
CREATE TABLE scenario_templates (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  theme VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  narrative_arc JSONB NOT NULL,
  character_prompts JSONB NOT NULL,
  hidden_quests JSONB NOT NULL,
  time_rules JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Added: Mintlify Documentation Platform (lines 725-754)**

- Documentation structure and setup instructions
- Developer and user documentation strategy
- Interactive API documentation with OpenAPI integration
- Added Mintlify CLI to development prerequisites

#### 2. Implementation Readiness Assessment Updates (`docs/bmm-implementation-readiness-assessment-20251109.md`)

**Status Changes:**

- Overall readiness: 79% → 81% ⬆️
- Architecture Clarity: 98% → 100% ⬆️
- Technical Feasibility: 95% → 100% ⬆️
- Risk Management: 85% → 90% ⬆️
- Time to readiness: 8-16 hours → 4-8 hours ⬆️

**Resolved Issues:**

1. ✅ **Scenario Template Storage** (High Priority)

   - **Resolution:** Added PostgreSQL JSONB schema to Architecture
   - **Status:** Complete - Ready for Epic 3 implementation

2. ✅ **Testing Strategy** (Medium Priority)

   - **Approved:** pytest (backend) + Jest (frontend)
   - **Coverage targets:** ≥70% backend, ≥60% frontend
   - **Action:** Include testing stories in each epic

3. ✅ **CI/CD Pipeline** (Medium Priority)

   - **Approved:** GitHub Actions (CircleCI as alternative)
   - **Includes:** pytest runner, Jest + Playwright, Docker builds, pre-commit hooks
   - **Action:** Include in Epic 0 (Project Initialization)

4. ✅ **Monitoring & Observability** (Medium Priority)

   - **Approved:** Sentry for error tracking + structlog for logging
   - **Includes:** Request logging with request_id, cost tracking, alerts
   - **Action:** Add stories in Sprint 2-3

5. ✅ **Mintlify Documentation** (New)
   - **Approved:** Mintlify for interactive documentation
   - **Includes:** API reference, architecture guides, code examples
   - **Action:** Add documentation setup to Epic 0

**Deferred:**

- ⏸️ **Highlight Reel Generation** → Post-MVP (not critical for launch)
  - Can be added incrementally after core features proven
  - Options documented for future implementation

#### 3. Gate Check Completion Status

**Before this session:**

- 1/5 criteria met (20%)

**After this session:**

- 4/5 criteria met (80%)

**Remaining:**

- ⏳ Epic and story breakdown document (4-8 hours estimated)

   - Status: Blocking implementation start

2. **Sprint 1 Priorities:**
   - Epic 0: Project Initialization (includes CI/CD, Mintlify setup)
   - Epic 8: User Onboarding & Auth
   - Epic 1: Companion & Memory System (foundation)

### Files Modified

1. `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (2 additions)

3. `.cursor-changes` (new file)
   - Created change log to track project evolution

### Version Impact

**Previous state:** 0.2.0 (Planning complete, some gaps)  
**Current state:** 0.2.1 (Planning complete, implementation-ready with one blocker)  
**Next state:** 0.3.0 (After epic/story breakdown complete)

### Key Metrics
