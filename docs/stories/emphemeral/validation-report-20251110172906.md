### Source Document Coverage
Pass Rate: 5/5 (100%)
- ✓ Requirements context cites product brief, epics, tech spec, architecture, and UX spec (lines 13-16).
- ✓ Acceptance criteria cite tech spec and epics (lines 20-25).
- ✓ Dev Notes cite architecture, previous story, and UX spec (lines 55-82).
- ✓ Project structure notes reference the monorepo guide (lines 70-72) and References lists every supporting doc (lines 73-82).

### Acceptance Criteria Quality
Pass Rate: 4/4 (100%)
- ✓ Six ACs align with Story 1.3 requirements in the tech spec and epics (lines 20-25) and each is testable and atomic.
