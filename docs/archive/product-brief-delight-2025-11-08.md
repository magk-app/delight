# Product Brief: Delight

**Date:** 2025-11-08
**Author:** Jack
**Context:** Startup/solopreneur vision

---

## Project Identity

- **Name:** Delight
- **Naming Rationale:** A single, familiar word that signals warmth and effortlessness, countering perceptions of clunky AI tools.
- **Promise:** Deliver software that feels seamless and emotionally supportive while remaining ruthlessly effective—guiding people through difficult moments and propelling them toward goals faster than conventional productivity apps.

---

## Executive Summary

Delight is an intentionally simple, human word meant to reset expectations around AI software. The flagship experience is an AI companion inspired by “poke”-style helpers but evolved into an emotionally aware coach that can sense isolation, hold real conversations, and—even in ambitious future versions—introduce people to each other when connection matters most. Users never face big goals alone.

The companion keeps people moving by translating large, intimidating projects into digestible actions, celebrating micro-progress, and generating highlight reels that remind them their effort is working. When priorities become ambiguous or motivation dips, Delight leans into deeper coaching: it uncovers the underlying “why,” reinforces benefits, and uses smart incentives (social accountability, forfeits, rewards) to nudge users through the hard choices. The result is software that feels seamless, personally supportive, and far more effective than mainstream tools at pushing people toward what they truly want.

## Initial Vision Highlights

1. **Emotionally aware companion:** A conversational AI that blends empathy, coaching, and light social matchmaking so people feel seen, supported, and—eventually—introduced to like-minded peers when connection would help.
2. **Momentum scaffolding:** Breaks intimidating missions into micro-quests, daily “choose-one-of-three” priorities, and cinematic highlight reels so progress is visible even when outcomes lag.
3. **Motivation intelligence:** Uses gentle nudges, configurable notifications (in-app, SMS, email), and optional screen-time awareness to bring people back when they disappear without feeling nagged.
4. **Abstract goal navigation:** Treats hard-to-measure goals (move to Japan, build relationships, change careers) with nuance—probing for underlying motivations, mapping ambiguous steps, and staying permissive where other AI tools refuse to engage.

## Core Vision

### Problem Statement

People increasingly rely on AI-assisted tools, yet most experiences feel clunky, sterile, or overwhelming. Productivity apps demand constant manual upkeep, bury people in complex workflows, or fixate on surface-level gamification that never addresses the emotional reality of getting meaningful work done. Users are left alone during the hardest parts of their goals—overwhelm, hesitation, loss of momentum—precisely when they need a tool that feels present and helpful.

### Problem Impact

- People disappear for days or switch between apps when motivation dips, losing the context needed to restart.
- Big, abstract goals (moving abroad, finding a relationship, reinventing a career) feel impossible because traditional tools only track quantifiable tasks.
- Lack of micro-progress visuals causes users to assume “nothing is working,” triggering doomscrolling or avoidance loops.
- Without compassionate outreach—texts, emails, gentle reminders—people forget the tool even exists; when they return, it feels like starting over.
- Uneven accountability options mean users either feel micromanaged or entirely unsupported, so consistency erodes exactly when habits should cement.

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

- **Heavy maintenance:** Notion-style systems demand constant manual grooming; even AI templates still require the user to know what to ask for.
- **Deterministic helpers:** Most AI companions regurgitate generic advice, refuse nuanced topics because of rigid content filters, or cannot reason about messy life goals.
- **Shallow gamification:** Points and badges rarely connect to users’ real motivations, so the “game” becomes noise.
- **No human-feeling outreach:** Email reminders and push notifications lack the conversational tone—or channel flexibility—to feel like a caring check-in.
- **Limited social pathways:** Existing tools rarely facilitate introductions or shared rituals, so people remain isolated even when community would unlock progress.

### Proposed Solution

Delight pairs a context-aware AI companion with ritualized, story-driven experiences that feel seamless in daily life. The companion senses emotional signals, restructures plans, and quietly handles administrative overhead while core gameplay loops (Arena, Observatory, Commons) keep people progressing with a sense of belonging. Every interaction is designed to be emotionally supportive and more effective than mainstream tools: a simple prompt becomes a full plan, a hesitation becomes an encouraging nudge, and every win feeds into personalized streaks, highlight reels, and social rituals. Optional SMS/email nudges, screen-time awareness, and future social introductions ensure people are gently pulled back before abandonment becomes a pattern, while an abstract-goal planner surfaces the messy inner work that other AI systems ignore.

### Key Differentiators

1. **Companion-first UX:** Emotionally intelligent AI that blends therapy-grade listening with pragmatic coaching, escalating from personal reflection to social introductions when appropriate.
2. **Narrative momentum engine:** Micro-quests, highlight reels, and lore-rich zones make intangible work feel tangible and worth sharing.
3. **Motivation telemetry:** Multi-channel nudges plus optional device/screen-time insights give users honest feedback without judgment.
4. **Abstract goal modeling:** The system decomposes life goals that cannot be expressed as simple tasks, remaining open to sensitive conversations that other AI assistants reject.
5. **Belonging scaffolds:** Rituals, accountability pods, and—eventually—team/circle modes turn solitary self-improvement into a shared journey.

## Target Users

### Primary Users

- **Habit-building students:** High-school and university learners who want consistent study, wellness, or creative routines but struggle with motivation and don't want to configure complex systems.
- **Language learners and polymath generalists:** People juggling multiple learning tracks who need a gentle companion to break down practice, track streaks, and celebrate progress.
- **Tech professionals leveling up:** Engineers, designers, and product builders focused on becoming “better humans” alongside career growth; they expect high agency tools but crave emotional grounding.
- **Self-actualization & relationship seekers:** Individuals pursuing hard-to-measure life transformations (moving abroad, finding a partner, redefining identity) who need nuanced coaching rather than prescriptive task lists.

### Secondary Users

Small teams, accountability circles, and early-stage cohorts who want to anchor group rituals, share progress, and hold each other gently accountable. These users expand the companion into a shared space where introductions and co-op missions feel natural.

### User Journey

1. **Onboarding & emotional check-in:** Companion opens with an icebreaker, gauges mood, and co-creates the first quest plus a “choose one-of-three” priority slate.
2. **Daily flow:** Users receive micro-quests, ambient nudges, and streak updates; optional screen-time signals or SMS nudges bring them back if they drift.
3. **Progress storytelling:** Highlight reels, lore zones (Arena/Observatory/Commons), and shareable moments reinforce progress and invite light social interaction.
4. **Accountability & expansion:** As trust grows, users opt into social rituals, accountability pods, or future team modes; the companion can introduce peers when goals align.
5. **Reflection & recommitment:** Periodic retros synthesize learning, reset priorities, and evolve the plan for abstract goals without losing emotional context.

## Market Context

- Gamification drives productivity: 90% of employees report higher output when workflows include game mechanics, and engagement lifts ≈60% (per Delight life-plan research). Existing incumbents (Notion, Jira) under-deliver because setup complexity erodes that gain.
- AI productivity boom is crowded yet shallow: most assistants focus on task execution or summarization, not emotional coaching or abstract goal modeling.
- Learners and technologists actively seek community-backed accountability but distrust platforms that feel like surveillance; Delight’s lore-first framing offers a differentiated emotional tone.
- Competitive landscape: Habitica (RPG productivity), Goblin Tools (neurodivergent planning aids), and coach marketplaces. None combine empathetic AI, quantitative rigor, and narrative worlds.

## Financial Considerations

- Monetization path (post-MVP): subscription with tiered access to advanced rituals, co-op pods, and extra companion personas.
- Infrastructure costs anchored in Mem0 + Qdrant + Postgres stack; expected <$0.10 per active user per day at MVP scale.
- SMS/email nudges introduce marginal cost; limit to high-signal events until retention impact is proven.

## Technical Preferences

- **Architecture:** FastAPI backend (packages/backend) orchestrating workflows and memory, Next.js frontend (packages/frontend) delivering immersive UI, shared TypeScript types for consistency.
- **AI stack:** LangChain/LangGraph orchestration, Mem0 for persistent memory, Qdrant vector store, Redis for task memory, optional Letta/MemGPT upgrade later.
- **Knowledge graph:** NetworkX prototype scaling to Neo4j, enabling relationship/progress tracking and “introduction readiness” signals.
- **Data discipline:** All computations logged for replay; quantitative metrics stored in Postgres for analytics and the Consistency Dashboard.

## Organizational Context

- Founder-led initiative with direct line to research backlog (`docs/delight-plan.md`) and brainstorming outcomes.
- Requires close collaboration between AI/platform engineering (memory + orchestration), product design (narrative UX, storyboards), and growth (accountability rituals, communications).
- Documentation lives in `docs/` with workflows tracked via BMAD; ensures future contributors can pick up context quickly.

## Risks and Assumptions

- **Risk:** AI companion mishandles sensitive goals due to model constraints. *Mitigation:* Guardrail prompts + human-in-the-loop review for edge categories.
- **Risk:** Quantitative tracking feels punitive. *Mitigation:* Allow users to tune which metrics display and default to positive framing.
- **Risk:** Narrative system becomes gimmicky without real utility. *Mitigation:* Tie every story beat to verifiable work artifacts (quests, reflections, streaks).
- **Assumption:** Target personas are willing to enable SMS/email nudges if tone feels human.
- **Assumption:** Collaborative planning can occur via chat-first interface; no visual builder required initially.

## Timeline

- **Weeks 0-2:** Stand up companion + memory stack, ship conversational goal modeling prototype.
- **Weeks 3-4:** Layer in priority triads, DCI tracking, and highlight reel generation.
- **Weeks 5-6:** Add configurable nudges (email/SMS), polish narrative zones, conduct retention experiments with pilot cohort.
- **Weeks 7-8:** Harden analytics, prepare PRD workflow handoff, and evaluate expansion scope (screen-time beta, social pods).

## Supporting Materials

- `docs/bmm-brainstorming-session-2025-11-08.md` — ritual + persona ideation source.
- `docs/delight-plan.md` — detailed implementation plan, memory architecture, and to-do list.
